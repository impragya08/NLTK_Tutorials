# NLTK_Tutorials
This repository is a compilation of my personal learnings and code samples for the Natural Language Tool Kit library.


Here's what I learned:
* Introduction to NLP and NLTK
* Tokenization and stemming of text data
* Part-of-speech tagging and named entity recognition
* Text classification using machine learning algorithms


I also gained hands-on experience using Python and NLTK to preprocess and manipulate text data, train machine learning models, and visualize NLP results. 
Additionally, the course covered topics such as text classification using machine learning algorithms, sentiment analysis, topic modeling, word embeddings, and text similarity.
